      <h2>History of Singaporean Food</h2>
      <p>Since its founding as a British port in 1819, Singaporean cuisine has been influenced by different cultures due to its position as an international shipping port.[1] Singapore is geographically located in between the Pacific and Indian oceans but it also has the shape of a peninsula and an island at the same time, where various cultures and trades used to and continue to occur. Indonesia is located to the south, Thailand, China, the Philippines and Malaysia are located to the north and India is located to the west. Since Singapore's geographical position is surrounded by various Asian countries, there is much diversity in food and culture.</p>
