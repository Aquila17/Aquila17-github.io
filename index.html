            <p>In 1918, Singapore was founded as an international shipping port. Due to this, Singapore's cuisine has been influenced by many different cultures</p>
            <p>Singapore is located in between the Pacific and Indian oceans, surrounded by many Asian countries such as Indonesia, China, Malaysia and others. As such, the food and culture in Singapore is also just as diverse</p>

              Although Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819, it is believed that some popular Singaporean food known today orignated before he arrived.
              It is difficult to know when these dishes actually arrived in Singapore, since historical records on said food are scattered and likely inaccurate. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the creation of some Singaporean dishes are likely adaptations from early Singapore immigrants making dishes with their available ingredients, as well as suiting their food palette.
              These dishes are now well known dishes in Singaporean Cuisine, which includes dishes such as Curry Fish Head, and Kaya Toast.

              A large part of Singaporean Cuisine revolves around hawker centers. There is still many of them seen to this day, and they can be traced back all the way to the mid 19th-century.
              Back then, the vendors was relatively easy to set up, since they could set these up on the side of the roads with either push carts or bicycles.
              They were also able to serve food that was fast and cheap to many people.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, due to the lack of infrastructure supporting these vendors, such as waste disposal and a steady supply of fresh water, these stalls were unhygenic in the past.
              This has changed over the years, the most prominent change starting in the 1960s, where the Singapore Government began setting rules and regulations for hawkers.
              One other large change is the government relocated these street vendors to a more permanent location instead.

            To this day, Many Singaporeans flock to hawker centers on a daily basis to have their meals. This makes hawker centers incredibly crowded during peak hours
            Thus, it is difficult to carry one's meal from the vendor to a open table due to the large crowd at time.

          <p>
            Since Singapore is a multicultural nation, its food culture is widely diverse. 
            A common greeting for many Singaporeans is asking "Have you eaten?", as a way to greet the other person.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wide culture can also be seen in calender events or anniversaries.
            One example is the lunar new year, where it is tradition to eat a pastry called "Nian Gao".
            The pastry originates from China, but is an extension of Malay cuisine, influenced by the Chinese and Indians.
